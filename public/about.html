<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Evangelos Petsalis, though you may feel free to call me Vangelis as people do here in Greece (my home country).
  I am an aspiring web developer with a great will to succeed. I am also an EFL teacher, and have been so for many years now.</p>

<p>I have worked in foreign language schools and as a freelancer, teaching kids of various ages and adults. However, I've always felt
  that a great passion of mine was being left unexplored - computers. I've always been fascinated by the complexity found in software
  and video games. When I saw a simple code for the first time, it felt like a riddle was being unraveled before my eyes. Much like discovering
  the connection between the vibration of a string and actual music, my other unquenchable passion.</p>

<p>Since then, I've enrolled in various coding courses and I'm eagerly waiting for the chances, and challenges, that will help me hone my skills and help me
  become the best version of myself. Here's to more! </p>
